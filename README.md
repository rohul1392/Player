# Player

##  Pseudo Code

```
function Play(){ 
   Create Player object and play
end 
} 
function Forword(Argument one){ 
   Get the Forword value and forward play time.
end 
} 

function Rewind(Argument one){ 
      Get the Rewind value and Rewind play time.

end 
} 
```

##  design pattern
We can use Singleton design pattern to develop these three functionalities because we will create only one instance of a Player class.
